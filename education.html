                            deep analysis of the individual components of genomes, especially genes, is currently
                            essential. Determining the function of a gene is a key task in genomics applicable e.g.
                            in evolutionary biology, drug discovery and improvement, and personalized medicine.
                            The main objective of this doctoral thesis was to develop a solution enabling the analysis
                            of the genomic neighborhood of any bacterial gene to determine the biological function of an
                            unknown gene. The work began with the creation of an algorithm enabling the analysis of
                            genomic neighborhoods. A widely accessible tool was developed - a server and an extensive
                            database containing bacterial genomes, which allows for performing analyses. This doctoral
                            dissertation describes three projects. In each of them, analyses of genomic neighborhoods
                            were utilized, which were performed using the method developed within the dissertation,
                            as well as other bioinformatics methods. In the scope of the first project, the diversity
                            of bacterial families of Protein Kinase-Like (PKL) proteins was studied. As a result of the
                            conducted analyses, protein domains were identified, which significantly often appeared in
                            the analyzed neighborhoods. These essential protein domains were subject to further analysis
                            in terms of their presence in all PKL proteins, aiming to understand their potential common
                            functions. As a result of the conducted analyses, common domains in neighborhoods for
                            certain groups of PKL protein families were identified. However, for individual
                            PKL protein families, the presence of domains in neighborhoods was observed, which can be
                            considered characteristic for them and well conserved in the evolution process of bacterial
                            genomes. In the second project, a characterization of genomic neighborhoods was conducted
                            on a larger scale, utilizing genomes of bacteria belonging to the Legionella genus.
                            The main aim of these projects however, was to prepare a basis for the creation of a more
                            comprehensive and complex solution, which was presented in the third project. The proposed
                            tool - ProFaNA (Protein Family Neighborhood Analysis) - uses experiences from previous
                            projects and enables analyses on a much larger scale. ProFaNA allows for the analysis of
                            genomic neighborhoods based on an extensive database containing nearly 90 thousand bacterial
                            genomes, as well as enabling analysis within defined taxonomic groups. ProFaNA allows for
                            the examination of repeatable patterns of gene neighborhoods and identification of protein
                            families potentially functionally linked, which constitutes a significant step in expanding
                            our knowledge about the functions of bacterial genes.

                            Tasmanian devil is the largest carnivorous marsupial on Tasmania Island since
                            at the beginning of XX century thylacines had extinct. Genetic diversity observed in all
                            devils divided this species in two populations, northwest and east. Tasmanian devils are
                            legally protected for over 70 years and since 1996 devils are threatened by extinction
                            caused by fast developing disease that comes from a Schwann cell, Devil Facial Tumor
                            Disease (DFTD). This disease is malignancy and transferred from animal to animal
                            by tumor’s cells. Nowadays there is not known cure for the DFTD, however there are
                            some research that main goal is to create a vaccine against this disease. This thesis shows
                            three aspects; characteristic of Tasmanian devil’s species and connection between
                            behavior and transfer of Devil Facial Tumor (DFT), genetic diversity in free-living devils
                            and validity of division into east and northwest population and accurate presentation
                            of Devil Facial Tumor Disease.
