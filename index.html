            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome! I'm Dr. Bartosz Baranowski, a passionate and innovative PhD bioinformatician dedicated to advancing the understanding and application of genomic data in medical science.
                With over 5 years of experience in both academic and start-up environments,
                I specialize in developing computational tools and data analysis techniques that improve disease diagnosis and treatment strategies.
                I am driven by a deep curiosity about the genetic foundations of health and disease, and a commitment to solving complex problems through data-driven insights.
                I am currently focused on creating antibodies using purely AI , aiming to detect any given protein in any biological sample.
                Explore my portfolio to see the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, learn about my research, and feel free to connect if you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work.
